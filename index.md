## Harmonization

- Each country has its way of reporting economic information:
  - USA: $/cwt for farm gate price; $ for a gallon or half a gallon for retail
    price
  - CAN: $/hl for farm gate price; $ for a litre for retail price
  - Europe: euros/100 kg for farm gate price; euros per litre for retail price
  - New Zealand: dollars per 100 kg for farm gate price
- So all measures were harmonized as Canadian dollars per litre
- Also, exchange rate on the first day of the year was used to convert between
the currencies and Canadian dollars
